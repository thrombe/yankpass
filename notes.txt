. idea
  . encrypt stuff on phon. send hash to pc. decrypt and paste it.
    \. encrypt using some key(maybe cl argument, or su perms something-something) + time as salt
    \. find better ways to save this key. like what do other apps do to store sensi stuff?
  \. using same key on both sides (same salted hash func)
  . maybe phone is main device here, ie push button on phone abd stuff gets pasted on pc
  . can do something like, pc sends a public key (rpivate key can be big random no.) and phone locks it using that key. and sends the text to pc
    which can decrypt it

plan:
  . if text goes too big, send files via discord
